This project is a comprehensive web application for managing categories, subcategories, and products. The application allows users to create, update, and delete categories and subcategories, as well as manage products associated with those subcategories. Additionally, the project includes user authentication features such as registration, login, and a secure "Forgot Password" functionality that allows users to reset their passwords via a one-time password (OTP) sent to their email.

The application is built using React for the frontend and Django for the backend, providing a robust and scalable solution for managing a wide range of categories and products. The UI is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, ensuring a seamless experience for users.
